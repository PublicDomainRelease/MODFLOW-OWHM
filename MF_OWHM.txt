NAME
     MF-OWHM - One-Water Hydrologic Flow Model - (http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/tm6a51/)
                  Modular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water model 
               Version 1.00.00 (11/05/2014) includes MODFLOW-2005 - Version: 1.11.0  08/08/2013

ABSTRACT
     The One-Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MF-OWHM) is a MODFLOW-based integrated 
     hydrologic flow model (IHM) that is the most complete version, to date, of 
     the MODFLOW family of hydrologic simulators needed for the analysis of a 
     broad range of conjunctive-use issues. Conjunctive use is the combined use of 
     groundwater and surface water. MF-OWHM allows the simulation, analysis, and 
     management of nearly all components of human and natural water movement and 
     use in a physically-based supply-and-demand framework. MF-OWHM is based on 
     the Farm Process for MODFLOW-2005 (MF-FMP2) combined with Local Grid 
     Refinement (LGR) for embedded models to allow use of the Farm Process (FMP) 
     and Streamflow Routing (SFR) within embedded grids. MF-OWHM also includes 
     new features such as the Surface-water Routing Process (SWR), Seawater 
     Intrusion (SWI), and Riparian Evapotranspiration (RIP-ET), and new solvers 
     such as Newton-Raphson (NWT) and nonlinear preconditioned conjugate 
     gradient (PCGN). This IHM also includes new connectivities to expand the 
     linkages for deformation-, flow-, and head-dependent flows. 
     Deformation-dependent flows are simulated through the optional 
     linkage to simulated land subsidence with a vertically deforming mesh. 
     Flow-dependent flows now include linkages between the new SWR with 
     SFR and FMP, as well as connectivity with embedded models for SFR and 
     FMP through LGR. Head-dependent flows now include a modified Hydrologic 
     Flow Barrier Package (HFB) that allows optional transient HFB capabilities, 
     and the flow between any two layers that are adjacent along a depositional 
     or erosional boundary or displaced along a fault. MF-OWHM represents a complete 
     operational hydrologic model that fully links the movement and use of groundwater, 
     surface water, and imported water for consumption by irrigated agriculture, 
     but also of water used in urban areas and by natural vegetation. 
     Supply and demand components of water use are analyzed under demand-driven 
     and supply-constrained conditions. From large- to small-scale settings, 
     MF-OWHM has the unique set of capabilities to simulate and analyze historical, 
     present, and future conjunctive-use conditions. MF-OWHM is especially useful for 
     the analysis of agricultural water use where few data are available for pumpage,     
     land use, or agricultural information. The features presented in this IHM include 
     additional linkages with SFR, SWR, Drain-Return (DRT), Multi-Node Wells 
     (MNW1 and MNW2), and Unsaturated-Zone Flow (UZF). Thus, MF-OWHM helps to 
     reduce the loss of water during simulation of the hydrosphere and helps to 
     account for "all of the water everywhere and all of the time."
     
     In addition to groundwater, surface-water, and landscape budgets, MF-OWHM 
     provides more options for observations of land subsidence, hydraulic properties, 
     and evapotranspiration (ET) than previous models. Detailed landscape budgets 
     combined with output of estimates of actual evapotranspiration facilitates 
     linkage to remotely sensed observations as input or as additional observations 
     for parameter estimation or water-use analysis. The features of FMP have been 
     extended to allow for temporally variable water-accounting units (farms) that 
     can be linked to land-use models and the specification of both surface-water 
     and groundwater allotments to facilitate sustainability analysis and connectivity 
     to the Groundwater Management Process (GWM).
     
METHOD
     The ground-water flow equation is solved using the finite-difference
     approximation.  The flow region is subdivided into blocks in which
     the medium properties are assumed to be uniform.  In plan view the
     blocks are made from a grid of mutually perpendicular lines that may
     be variably spaced.  Model layers can have varying thickness.  A flow
     equation is written for each block, called a cell.  Several solvers
     are provided for solving the resulting matrix problem; the user can
     choose the best solver for the particular problem.  Flow-rate and
     cumulative-volume balances from each type of inflow and outflow are
     computed for each time step.


HISTORY
      MF-OWHM Version 1.0.00 This version is the initial release (MF-OWHM).
        See FUNTIONALITY for package listing.

DATA REQUIREMENTS
     In order to use MODFLOW, initial conditions, hydraulic properties,
     and stresses must be specified for every model cell in the finite-
     difference grid. Input data are read from files.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     MODFLOW-OWHM is written primarily in Fortran 90/95 and makes use of features
     in Fortran 2003 and 2008. Only the GMG solver package is written in C.  
     The code has been used on UNIX-based computers and personal computers 
     running various forms of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
