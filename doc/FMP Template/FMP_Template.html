# FMP4 ALL INPUT OPTIONS
#
#   This is a simple text file that provides the FMP basic block input structure
#      all the currently supported keywords, and a brief description.
#      This document can serve as a template for building new models or cheat sheet
#      for quickly looking up keywords.
#
#   Comments are preceded with a # symbol and block input starts with the keyword BEGIN
#      and terminates with the keyword END
#
#   The FMP4 input accepts the input blocks in any order and
#       within a block the its keywords may be specified in any order.
#
#   Syntax highlighting is supported in the text editor Notepad++. This will make this file easier to read.
#          Please see the folder: Syntax_Highlighting_Notepad++ 
#             which contains a readme.doc that explains how to install the syntax files, which have the extension .xml in the folder.

#
#   The following is a brief description of the shorthand notation and input structures
#
#   This is a full listing of all keywords, 
#     however some are optional and use default values when not specified.
#
#  [ ] are used to nest optional arguments and keywords used in the input
#  { } are used to nest arguments, where one must be chosen
#
#  GENERIC_INPUT  -- Specify name of input  file, primary keywords supported are 
#                                           CONSTANT    Value ==&gt; If allowed, then indicates that Value is read and used as input
#                                           INTERNAL          ==&gt; Read input on subsequent lines
#                                           OPEN/CLOSE  file  ==&gt; Open "file", load input, then close the file.
#                                           DATAFILE    file  ==&gt; Open "file", load input, keep current read position in memory and file remains open until simulation ends. If file is a Transient File Reader (TFR) then the DATAFILE indicates input is directly loaded rather than looking for TFR directives.
#                                           EXTERNAL    unit  ==&gt; Load input on unit number "unit"
#                                           DATAUNIT    unit  ==&gt; Load input on unit number "unit", for TFR has same effect as a DATAFILE, but uses the unit number.
#                                           SKIP or NULL     ==&gt; Iqnores file I/O
#                                           implied_internal  ==&gt; Not a keyword ==&gt; Special case when no keyword is found, then input is assumed to be on current line.
#
#                 -- GENERIC_INPUT has a set of post-keywords that are read after the primary keyword.
#                    The post-keywords are:
#                          SF Scale    ==&gt;  Reads in the number Scale and multiplies it to the input within the GENERIC_INPUT file. 
#                                           The post-keyword "SF" is optional and if only a number is found, then it is treated as SCALE
#                          BUFFER BUF  ==&gt;  Preload input file into BUF kilobytes of RAM. If not specified, then default value is 32 KB. BUF should not be larger than 1024 KB.
#                          REWIND      ==&gt;  If file is already opened from EXTERNAL, DATAFILE, or DATAUNIT, then rewind file to the first line. Otherwise, do nothing.
#                          DIM    N    ==&gt;  If input supports a DIMENSION specification, then N overrides the default DIM. For example, if GENERIC_INPUT is opening a TFR, then DIM N will override the buffer line length used for identifying keywords and loading ImpliedInternal input (note the TFR default is 700 characters).
#
#  GENERIC_OUTPUT -- Specify name of output file, same keywords as GENERIC_INPUT, but represent file to write too. INTERNAL will write to LIST, but is not recommended.
#                 -- GENERIC_OUTPUT has a set of post-keywords that are read after the primary keyword.
#                    The post-keywords are:
#                          BUFFER BUF  ==&gt;  Write output file to RAM until it uses BUF kilobytes of memory and then write to file. If not specified, then default value is 32 KB. BUF should not be larger than 1024 KB. Note that output is written in BUF chunks to the hard drive.
#                          SPLIT  SPT  ==&gt;  When file size exceeds SPT megabytes, start a new file with a sequential number appended to the file name. This results in large output files being broken into smaller pieces.
#
#  ULOAD =&gt; Universal loader, loads either a scalar, a vector, or array.
#           ULOAD uses GENERIC_INPUT to specify the location of the input date
#           The input that is loaded is designated with the following shorthand:
#
#          INT    =&gt; Integer; 1 ,2, -1, -2
#          FLOAT  =&gt; Floating Point Number; 1., 1.0, 1.1, -1.5, 1E0, 1D0
#          CHAR   =&gt; Character string/text/predefined words
#          DTIM   =&gt; One-Water DateTime Objects ( any accepted date format, such as mm/dd/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyyThh:ss:mm or yyyy-mm-dd )
#          TSF    =&gt; Time Series Files (either a single file or set of files) as described in Appendix 2, Time Series Files (TSF)
#          LU_TAB =&gt; LookUp Table, follows the input structure for a LookUp Table as described in Appendix 6, Lookup-Table Input Structure
# 
#          ULOAD may optional load an INT record identifier (ID) before reading one row of input 
#                                                               (This is called List-Style Input).
#
#  ULOAD Input Examples =&gt; Data is loaded with ULOAD using the List-Style or Array-Style input.
#                          Note that the keywords "TRANSIENT", "STATIC", "ARRAY", and "LIST" are discussed later under "LAI =&gt; List-Array Input Style"
#           
#        List-Style reads a set of records of the structure (record ID, property).
#             List-Style supports reading in more than one property per ID, such that (record ID, property1, property2, etc)
#             Typically the number of records is the same for each block.
#             For example the WATER_BALANCE_SUBREGION Block reads NWBS records when using List-Style.
#             The number of records MUST be well ordered, starting with 1 and sequentially increasing to the number or records.
#
#        Array-Style reads in a NROW by NCOL array.
#
#           The following is an example ULOAD with NROW = 3,  NCOL = 5, NWBS = 4, and NIRRIGATE = 2
#
#                   The first example loads a single property used by the keyword "DEFICIENCY_SCENARIO STATIC LIST" ULOAD
#                     (Note that the words "STATIC" and "LIST" are discussed later.)
#
#                     DEFICIENCY_SCENARIO STATIC LIST ULOAD could have ULOAD as:
#
#                                        DEFICIENCY_SCENARIO STATIC LIST   OPEN/CLOSE Input.txt
#                    where Input.txt is:  _________________________
#                                        | #RecID  DeficiencyFlag  |
#                                        |    1     1              |
#                                        |    2     1              |
#                                        |    3     1              |
#                                        |    4     1              |
#                                        ---------------------------
#                   or 
#                                         DEFICIENCY_SCENARIO STATIC LIST   INTERNAL
#                                            #RecID  DeficiencyFlag
#                                               1     1
#                                               2     1
#                                               3     1
#                                               4     1
#
#                   If no GENERIC_INPUT keyword is detected and List-Style only load a single property, 
#                      then it will assume an ImpliedInternal Load (note the record ID is not read and is implied by the order of the input).
#
#                   For example:
#                                         DEFICIENCY_SCENARIO STATIC LIST  1  1  1  1
#                   or more simply just:
#                                         DEFICIENCY_SCENARIO STATIC LIST  CONSTANT 1
#
#                   An example of List-Style with 2 properties loaded (e.g. EFFICIENCY keyword).
#                   Record ID is the the WBS number, and represents where the properties are applied,
#                   and after the RecID is the EFFICIENCY for each irrigation type for that WBS.
#                                         EFFICIENCY STATIC LIST  INTERNAL
#                                            #RecID  IRR1  IRR2
#                                               1    0.6   0.8
#                                               2    0.6   0.8
#                                               3    0.6   0.8
#                                               4    0.6   0.8
#
#                   Array-Style reads NROW by NCOL values 
#                   to apply properties spatially rather then through the record ID
#                   The keyword EFFICIENCY supports both List-Style and Array-Style. 
#                   The following is Array-Style:
#                                         EFFICIENCY STATIC ARRAY  INTERNAL
#                                               0.6  0.6  0.6  0.8  0.8
#                                               0.6  0.6  0.6  0.8  0.8
#                                               0.6  0.6  0.6  0.8  0.8
#
#  TFR =&gt; Transient File Reader   -- Read when the keyword "TRANSIENT" is present
# 
#         TFR is a file that contains on each uncommented row a ULOAD that specifies the stress period (SP) input.
#         The TFR file is opened with GENERIC_INPUT, which supports all its keywords except INTERNAL.
#             --Note that that is the TFR cannot be loaded with INTERNAL, but within the TFR a ULOAD may use INTERNAL.
#
#           For example a TFR could be opened with: OPEN/CLOSE  TFR.txt
#
#           The general structure of a TFR is: _____________________
#                                              |  ULOAD   # SP 1   |
#                                              |  ULOAD   # SP 2   |
#                                              |                   |   Blank lines are ignored and skipped
#                                              |  ULOAD   # SP 3   |
#                                              |  ULOAD   # SP 4   |
#                                              |  # Comment        |   Line is ignored cause its commented
#                                              |  ULOAD   # SP 5   |
#                                              |  ULOAD   # SP 6   |  ==&gt; and so forth for each stress period
#                                              ---------------------
#
#           If a TFR file is opened with DATAFILE or DATAUNIT, then it is assumed that the input data directly resides in the file.
#              This file is called a Direct Data File (DDF), which bypasses the need to specify for each stress period the location of the input.
#              The closest equivalent would be as if a TFR was specified with all its ULOADS with INTERNAL, but the lines that contained INTERNAL are deleted.
#
#           Within the TFR each ULOAD supports the following keywords:
#                 [SFAC]      =&gt; Optional keyword to indicate that advanced scale factors are applied to the keyword on the next line (that is the next stress periods input)
#                 SKIP        =&gt; Input is skipped and automatically set to zero (NULL works as well)
#                 CONSTANT    =&gt; Input is set to a single value that is read after the word CONSTANT ==&gt; CONSTANT 5.5
#                 INTERNAL    =&gt; Input is on subsequent lines
#                 OPEN/CLOSE  =&gt; Input within the file name specified after OPEN/CLOSE. 
#                                   File is opened in memory, input loaded from start of file and then is closed once loaded. If file is reopened with OPEN/CLOSE then it loads from the first line.
#                 DATAFILE    =&gt; Input within the file name specified after DATAFILE. 
#                                   First call of DATAFILE opens in memory, input loaded from start of file, and position within file remains until file is loaded again and the file remains open until simulation ends. 
#                                   Subsequent calls to the same DATAFILE will continue loading from where the last load ended.
#                 EXTERNAL    =&gt; Input within the unit number specified after EXTERNAL, which is specified in the name file as "DATA unit" or "DATA(BINARY) unit". This is equivalent to DATAFILE except the file is declared in the NAME file and referenced by unit number.
#                 DATAUNIT    =&gt; Same as EXTERNAL
#                 REPEAT      =&gt; Reuse previously loaded input, any previously applied scale factors are not carried forward
#                 RELOAD      =&gt; Move previously used file to first line and load input from the start. Previous file must have been opened with DATAFILE, DATAUNIT, OR EXTERNAL
#                 LOAD_NEXT   =&gt; Load previously used file to at its current location with the file.    Previous file must have been opened with DATAFILE, DATAUNIT, OR EXTERNAL
#
#       The following is an example TFR file that is read for the keyword CROP_COEFFICIENT with NCROP = 2:
#                                        CROP_COEFFICIENT  TRANSIENT LIST  OPEN/CLOSE   TFR.txt
#                    where TFR.txt is:  ____________________________________________________
#                                      |  INTERNAL   # SP 1  - ULOAD using INTERNAL keyword |
#                                      |  1      0.9                                        |
#                                      |  2      0.6                                        |
#                                      |  INTERNAL   # SP 2                                 |
#                                      |  1      1.1                                        |

#  LAI =&gt; List-Array Input Style -- Directs if input is loaded once, by stress period and the input structure.
#
#  LAI[S,T,A,L] =&gt; Letters indicate the supported keyword options:
#
#                      S = STATIC    =&gt; ULOAD                       -&gt; Data is loaded once with ULOAD for entire simulation
#
#                      T = TRANSIENT =&gt; Transient File Reader (TFR) -&gt; Data is loaded      with TFR that specifies the input location for each stress period. 
#                                                                                          **Note that if TFR is opened with DATAFILE or DATAUNIT then the TFR is bypassed and the data is loaded directly.
#                      A = ARRAY     =&gt; Data input is NROW by NCOL array-style loaded with ULOAD
#                      L = LIST      =&gt; Data input is record based list-style  loaded with ULOAD using the structure of (record ID, input). The number of records depends on the input type (for example NWBS or NCROP records)
#
# LAI[S,T,A,L-N] =&gt; N indicates number of List-Style properties that must be read. For example, LAI[S,T,L-2] indicates that STATIC and TRANSIENT keywords are supported and input is LIST with three columns =&gt; (record ID, input1, input2)
#                   N is only specified when it is &gt;1, otherwise it is assumed to be 1
#
# Examples for a Keyword "Property"
#    Property LAI[S,T,A,L] accepts:
#           Property STATIC     ARRAY  ULOAD    # Data is specified as an array; loaded once by ULOAD; and used for entire simulation.  ***Note that ULOAD is replaced by a GENERIC_INPUT keyword that points to where the data is.
#           Property TRANSIENT  ARRAY  TFR      # Data is specified as an array; loaded each stress period by a TFR.                    ***Note that TFR   is replaced by a GENERIC_INPUT keyword that points to where the TFR is located. If the TFR is opened with DATAFILE or DATAUNIT, then the raw data is expected to reside in the file (that is no ULOAD on each line in the TFR, but just the raw data).
#           Property STATIC     LIST   ULOAD    # Data is specified as an List;  loaded once by ULOAD; and used for entire simulation.  ***Note that ULOAD is replaced by a GENERIC_INPUT keyword that points to where the data is.
#           Property TRANSIENT  LIST   TFR      # Data is specified as an List;  loaded each stress period by a TFR.                    ***Note that TFR   is replaced by a GENERIC_INPUT keyword that points to where the TFR is located.

#  A TSF is similar to a LookUp Table, but the first column must be a DTIM format (date or decimal year).                #
#  A TSF has METHODS that are better for time based interpretation and optimzied for unlimited file length               #
#                                                                                                                        #
#  A TSF may query a custom DTIM, which either is a single date or date range.                                           #
#  If the TSF uses the time step's date, then it uses the ending date of the time step.                                  #
#  If the TSF uses a date range, then it uses the start and ending dates for the time step.                              #
#                                                                                                                        #

#  The name refers to the input structure where it expects on an input line zero or more INT (I),                        #
#    then zero or more FLAOT (X), then zero or more INT (J)                                                              #

#  IXJ input loads each line in a file --parsing the I, X, and J inputs-- until the end of file is reached               #
#    or the keyword "STOP IXJ" is found on a line.                                                                       #

#  The meaning of the input for I, X, and J depend on the keyword, which will be decribed in its input.                  #
#    The common input is ROW, COL, VALUE, where ROW and COL are the model row and column location,                       #
#    and VALUE is the number value to assign there.                                                                      #

#  If IXJ is replacing Array-Style Input, then any row and column note defined with IXJ is asumed to be zero             #
#                                                                                                                        #
#  For example, PRECIPITATION specifies the rainfal rate as a NROW by NCOL array.                                        #
